Here you will find all the files you need to build an ESP8266-based window sensor whose battery will last for several years.  
Have a look at my video on Youtube:

Here you can find the code (ArduinoIDE/PlatformIO) for the microcontroller, the Gerber files for PCB ordering, the circuit simulation for CircuitJS and additional information.
